# ensemblenet

This short project is an example of how to build out an ensemble, stacking neural network for classifcation using Keras, TF2, the MNIST dataset, and the dogs vs cats dataset that can be found on Kaggle.
Read this [article](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/stacking-convolutional-neural-nets

 implementation steps for conv-nets and stacking models.
